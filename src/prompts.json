Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}, i.e., formatted as follows: '\\boxed{predicted_activity_name}'.\n\nDecision Rules:\n1. Find the trace in the past traces that is equal or contains the sequence of activities of the prefix to predict.\n2. For the selected trace, identify the next activity and return it as the predicted next activity for that prefix.\n3. If multiple traces are equal or contain the sequence of activities of the prefix to predict, do not directly consider the most frequent next activity but choose as the next activity the one immediately following the last of the prefix in the matching trace reasoning on the similarity of its values for the attributes in 'Values' with the values for the attributes of the prefix.\n\n",
