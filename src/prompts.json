Compare the prefix to past traces and find the closest match based on:\n   - Sequential similarity: Match the prefix in the same order as in past traces.\n   - Attribute similarity: Use 'Values' as additional criteria to refine the match.\n\n2. For the closest matching trace(s):\n   - Select the activity immediately following the prefix.\n\n3. If multiple traces match the prefix equally well:   - Choose the most frequent next activity among matching traces.\n   - Use attributes in 'Values' to break ties if necessary.\n\n",
